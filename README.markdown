# Turntable Remote

This bookmarklet was built to act as a mini remote control to display the currently playing info along
the bottom of the screen to let you see whats going on while keeping TT in the background and
getting some work done.  It also includes an autobopper (will automatically vote Awesome for every
song) that can be turned on and off in case you come and go and don't want to have to refresh the 
browser to regain control of your voting (or in case something really aweful gets played).

The idea is also to potentially expand the feature set for it to replace some common/favorite 
extension features and be more cross-browser friendly.  This is in no way affiliated with 
turntable.fm and use at your own risk.

This bookmarklet is hosted at http://bestroomontt.com/tt-remote/tt_remote.js if you want to run 
the latest version without hosting your own.

Cheers!

## Features

* Displays more complete metadata for currently playing track including album name, cover art and genre.

* Mute song feature mutes a song if you don't like it but will return audio to the previously set
  volume when a new song starts.
  
* Autobop.  
  ** Can be turned on and off at any time. 
  ** Options to vote Awesome for all songs or only songs played by DJs who you are a fan of.  
  ** Vote is triggered on a delay so you have time to disable if someone plays a song you don't like
    but don't want to lame.
  ** Vote is only cast once per song, so you can Lame after Awesome is triggered without Awesome vote
    automatically being sent again.

* Close button "X" to close TT Remote at any time.
